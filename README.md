## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to **ingest, parse, and analyze DNS logs** using **Splunk Enterprise**.  
Using **Zeek-style JSON DNS logs**, we perform security-focused DNS traffic analysis with **Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)**.

The project helps in identifying:
- Frequently queried domain names  
- Most active client IPs  
- DNS query type distribution  
- Potential anomalies in DNS behavior  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn how to:

- Ingest JSON-formatted DNS logs into Splunk
- Extract useful DNS metadata (queries, IPs, record types)
- Write SPL queries for DNS traffic analysis
- Detect suspicious or abnormal DNS activity
- Build a foundation for DNS-based threat detection

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Splunk Enterprise**
- **Zeek DNS Logs (JSON format)**
- **Search Processing Language (SPL)**

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of **Zeek-style DNS logs** in JSON format containing the following fields:

```

ts          → Timestamp
id.orig_h  → Source IP address
id.resp_h  → DNS server IP
qtype      → DNS query type (A, AAAA, PTR, CNAME)
query      → Queried domain name
answers    → DNS response
rcode      → DNS response code
rtt        → Round Trip Time

```

4. Configure:
- **Source Type:** `json` (or custom `zeek:dns`)
- **Index:** create a new index like `dns_lab` (recommended)

### Step 2: Verify Data Ingestion
Run the following SPL query:

```spl
index=dns_lab | head 5
````

## 🔍 Lab Tasks & SPL Queries

### 🔹 Task 1: Most Frequently Queried Domain Names

Identify the domains queried most often.

```spl
index=dns_lab 
| stats count by query
| sort -count
```

**Use Case:** Detect suspicious domains, beaconing behavior, or malware C2 traffic.

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Most Active Client IPs

Find hosts generating the highest DNS traffic.

```spl
index=dns_lab 
| stats count by "id.orig_h"
| sort -count
```

**Use Case:** Identify compromised systems or misconfigured devices.

---

### 🔹 Task 3: DNS Query Type Breakdown

Analyze DNS record types in the environment.

```spl
index=dns_lab 
| stats count by qtype
```

**Common Types:**

* `A` → IPv4 address lookup
* `AAAA` → IPv6 address lookup
* `CNAME` → Canonical name mapping
* `PTR` → Reverse DNS lookup

---

## 📈 Key Findings

* Identified **top queried domains** (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Yahoo)
* Discovered **high-volume DNS-generating client IPs**
* Observed distribution of **A, AAAA, CNAME, and PTR records**
* Analyzed **response time (RTT)** and failed DNS resolutions
* Established a baseline for DNS behavior

Future improvements may include:

* Splunk dashboards for DNS activity visualization
* Alerts for:

  * High DNS query volume
  * NXDOMAIN spikes
  * Rare or newly observed domains
